<h2 align="center">Install:</h2>

**NOTE: If you are coming from a different FW, it is recommended to delete / clear your "apps" folder on the SD card prior to updating. This folder houses all the .fap files, which do not update to the correct API versions by default if old ones are present (Thanks flipper devs). This does `NOT` remove any of your saved files!**
<br><br>

- Download the latest release (.zip).
- Extract the archive. This is now your new Firmware folder
- Open [qFlipper](https://flipperzero.one/update), head to `SD/Update` and simply move the firmware folder there
- On the Flipper, hit the `Arrow Down` button, this will get you to the file menu. Hit `Arrow Left` once, and then simply search for your updates folder
- Inside that folder, select the Firmware you just moved onto it, and run the file thats simply called `Update`

- Enjoy!
